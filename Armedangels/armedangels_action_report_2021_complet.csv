THE
ARMEDANGELS
STRIP SHOW
Yeah, we make clothes. But in this very re-
vealing 2021 Action Report, we’re stripping
down to our bare asses.
That’s right. We want you to see what’s
beneath the material: our naked truths.
We’ve got nothing to hide, we are how
nature made us. (Are we being too forward
in this foreword? Maybe. But if every
fashion brand was open enough to show you
its nipples, perhaps the world wouldn’t
be on fire, right?)"

Ah, imagine it. A fully circular fashion industry, with the hig-
hest environmental and social justice. A future where water,
energy and chemicals are regenerated. Where all materials we use
and products we sell can be reused and reclaimed.
It’s great to paint a utopian vision for our industry. But the
most important thing is making it happen."

WHY CIRCULARITY IS
THE ONLY WAY TO GO.
Each year, the fashion industry is • Roughly 10% of global greenhouse gas
responsible for: emissions2
• less than 1% of clothing being recycled2
• Around 92 million tons of textile waste3
SO, WHAT’S THE SOLUTION?
MANAGING WASTE IS NOT JUST ABOUT
RECYCLING. IT’S ABOUT CREATING AN
INDUSTRY THAT OPERATES WITH THE
HIGHEST ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE.
IT’S ABOUT CREATING SYSTEMS IN
WHICH WATER, ENERGY, CHEMICALS ARE

At ARMEDANGELS there is only one way, being

It can include dissatisfaction about the work
equipment, about noise level or temperature or
about the taste of the food in the canteen.
But obviously, it can also shed light on se-
vere human rights violations, such as discri-
mination against women or minorities, sexual
abuse, excessive overtime or failure to com-
ply with legal minimum wages. Most grievances

course of everyday working life in a factory.
Others need a more formal approach and manage-
ment systems need to be adjusted and procedu-
res need to be implemented. We feel that it is
our responsibility to support our suppliers
