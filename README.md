## Project Overview

This repository contains the complete codebase developed for the **Web Mining (MLSMM2153)** course at UCLouvain.  
The project applies automated web mining techniques to analyze **how sustainable fashion brands communicate sustainability through their online product descriptions**.

It relies on the three core methodological pillars taught in the course:

1. **Scraping** – automated extraction of web data  
2. **Text Mining** – NLP, TF-IDF, clustering, semantic similarity  
3. **Link Analysis** – graph construction and network metrics  

---

## Project Theme

The project studies the **linguistic and semantic construction of sustainability discourse** in ethical e-commerce.  
It investigates whether sustainability is framed as:

- a technical performance attribute  
- a moral or ESG-driven narrative  
- or a secondary certification-based argument  

---

## Research Questions

1. Which semantic markers are mobilized by sustainable fashion brands to promote their products?
2. What is the semantic distance between institutional ESG discourse and product-level descriptions?
3. Can semantic similarity between products be modeled as a graph revealing central and bridge products?

---

## Data Sources

The corpus is built from three international sustainable fashion brands:

- **Patagonia** (USA) – technical and environmental activism  
- **Ecoalf** (Spain) – circular economy and recycling  
- **Armedangels** (Germany) – slow fashion and social certifications  

All data was collected from **English-language versions** of the websites.

## Methodology

### Web Scraping

Scraping was performed using real browser automation to bypass anti-bot protections.

**Main technologies:**
- `playwright` (browser simulation)
- `asyncio`
- `BeautifulSoup`
- `pandas`

**Collected elements:**
- product URLs
- product names
- breadcrumbs (categories)
- sustainability and technical descriptions
- ESG reports (PDF → text)

---

### Text Mining

The text mining pipeline includes:

- text cleaning and normalization
- stopword filtering (NLTK + custom lists)
- lemmatization
- unigram and bigram tokenization
- TF-IDF vectorization
- k-Means clustering (elbow method & silhouette score)
- PCA for visualization
- cosine similarity
- lexical dictionary analysis (ESG / Materials / Technical)

---

### Link Analysis

Products are modeled as nodes in a similarity graph:

- edges weighted by cosine similarity
- thresholded adjacency matrix
- metrics:
  - degree centrality
  - shortest path
  - betweenness centrality

Graph visualization is performed using **Gephi**.

## Scripts Index

| Script | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| `*_links_*.py` | Collect product URLs |
| `*_scraper.py` | Extract product descriptions |
| `preprocessing.py` | Text cleaning |
| `tfidf_vectorizer.py` | TF-IDF matrices |
| `clustering_main.py` | k-Means clustering |

## Academic Context & Disclaimer

This repository was developed **strictly for academic purposes** within the Web Mining course at UCLouvain.  
It does not aim to evaluate brands ethically nor validate sustainability claims.
